Library Management System

A basic Java console application that simulates a Library Management System. Users can register, borrow and return books, and search for books by title or author.

##  Features

- Add books to the library
- Register users
- Show all available and borrowed books
- Borrow a book by title and user ID
- Return a borrowed book
- Search for books by keyword (in title or author)
- Menu-driven interface using `Scanner`

- ##  How It Works

The system uses:
- `Book` class: represents a book with title, author, and borrowed status.
- `User` class: represents a library user with name and user ID.
- `Library` class: manages book and user lists, and handles borrow/return logic.
- `LibraryManagementSystem` class: contains the `main()` method with a user menu.

##  Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Any IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal with Java setup
